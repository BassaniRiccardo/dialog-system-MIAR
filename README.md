This project contains the work done in the course "Methods in AI Research", at Utrecht University.
The project consists of a pyhton implementation of a text-based dialog system, which gives a restaurant recommendation based on the preferences given by the user.
The system classifies user utterances with a decision tree, assigning a dialog act to each utterence. The dialog policy is managed by a finite state function, and the necessary information are retrieved from a database. Further details are available in the report.
